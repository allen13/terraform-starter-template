# Terraform Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices to follow when working with this Terraform template.

## Code Organization

### Directory Structure

- Keep the directory structure consistent and maintain a clear separation between environments and modules
- Organize modules by their logical function rather than by resource type
- Use meaningful names for files and directories

### Naming Conventions

- Use snake_case for resource names, variables, and outputs
- Prefix resources with a descriptive identifier (e.g., `app_security_group`)
- Keep the naming consistent across all environments
- Use descriptive tags to identify resources in the cloud provider console

## Module Design

- **Single Responsibility**: Each module should focus on a specific function
- **Encapsulation**: Hide internal details and expose only what's necessary through variables and outputs
- **Reusability**: Design modules to be reusable across different environments and projects
- **Documentation**: Include a README.md file for each module explaining its purpose, inputs, and outputs

## State Management

- Always use remote state with locking
- Store state file in a secure, versioned backend (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCS)
- Never store state files in version control
- Use state file isolation for each environment to prevent cross-environment impact

## Variables and Outputs

- Define all input variables in a variables.tf file with descriptions
- Specify variable types and use constraints where appropriate
- Mark sensitive variables with the `sensitive = true` attribute
- Output useful information for consumers of the module
- Use locals for computing values used in multiple places

## Security

- Follow the principle of least privilege when defining IAM policies
- Store sensitive data in secure storage (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
- Never hardcode credentials in Terraform files
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Regularly audit and rotate credentials

## Version Control

- Use a version control system (Git) for all Terraform code
- Branch for each significant change
- Use pull requests for code reviews
- Tag releases with semantic versioning

## CI/CD

- Automate the Terraform workflow with CI/CD pipelines
- Run `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate` during the build process
- Generate and review plans before applying changes
- Use environment-specific approvals for production deployments

## Testing

- Use `terraform validate` to check for syntax errors
- Use `terraform plan` to verify changes before applying
- Consider using tools like Terratest for automated testing
- Implement policy-as-code tools like OPA or Checkov to enforce security and compliance

## Documentation

- Maintain up-to-date documentation for each module
- Document the architecture and design decisions
- Include examples of how to use the modules
- Document operational procedures for maintenance tasks

## Performance and Cost

- Use data sources to query existing resources rather than hardcoding values
- Implement cost tagging strategies
- Regularly review and optimize resource provisioning
- Consider implementing auto-scaling where appropriate

## Terraform Version

- Specify the required Terraform version in the versions.tf file
- Pin provider versions to avoid unexpected changes
- Stay up to date with Terraform releases, but test thoroughly before upgrading

## Error Handling

- Use `count` and `for_each` for creating multiple similar resources
- Use `depends_on` to explicitly define dependencies when necessary
- Handle errors gracefully with conditionals and validations
- Implement proper timeout and retry mechanisms

## Community Modules

- Prefer official and community modules for common infrastructure patterns
- Evaluate the quality and maintenance status of modules before using them
- Pin module versions to specific releases
- Understand what the module does before incorporating it
